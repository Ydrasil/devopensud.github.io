## FAQ
*The event will be made by those who will be there*.

#### What is DevOpenSud?

Somewhere in the Pyrennées, in the middle of nowhere some developers gathered in a cottage to talk, code, walk, pair, collaborate, play, cook, do things...

#### Who organise that thing?

There are `s/not really/really no/` organisers.

#### How much does it cost?

We don't know exactly yet, but it won't be above 20 or 30 euros by day (tax excl).

#### Can I come to work during the day and play with you at night?

Yes, Dev Open Sud 2017 is also meant to be an ephemeral co-working space.

#### Should I pay something now?

Nope. We trust you. You'll pay everything at the end of the event.

#### Can I have an invoice?

Yes, we can do that.

#### Where do I sign?

Registration is here: [subscribe](https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io/edit/master/inscriptions.md)

#### How many people will be there?

Maybe 2, maximum 10, probably around 8.

#### Is there some carpooling planned to reach the event?

Well, `we` won't plan anything, but `you` can use the mailing list [devopensud-2016@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/devopensud-2016) to organise it :)

#### How are the room?

There are 8 rooms, from 1 to 9 beds. Some are bunk beds, some are single bed or double bed. [Some pictures of the rooms](https://www.flickr.com/photos/111225529@N08/sets/72157638699048785/).

#### Can I have a room with no snorer?

You probably could find a way to organise a room with no snorer. But it may be a good idea to come with earplugs :)

#### What will we eat?

It is not decided yet. But if you have some food constraints (no gluten, allergies, vegan, ...) please, tell us as soon as possible so we can consider it.

#### By the way, where is it?

> DevOpenSud 2016 will be held at "Equisud" near Angles (66) in France. More infos on the website of "[Equisud](http://www.equisud.com/)" (in French).

## But your English is awful?

Yes, we know. We are French. But we will be very happy if you help us improve this page (and our bad English): [https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io](https://github.com/devopensud/devopensud.github.io).

## You will maximise your chances of satisfaction if

* you organise yourself and don't rely only on the non-organisers
* you follow the [law of two feet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Law_of_two_feet)
* you know that those who will be there will be the right ones.
